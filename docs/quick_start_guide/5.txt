5) Convert fieldline files and gdump files from HARM into V5D files
Version 6 Created by Jonathan M. on 13 Feb 2013. Previous Version
1) Assuming harmgit tree is at ~/harmgit/ and the run directory is in ~/harmgit/run/ , then:

cd ~harmgit/
git pull   [THIS GETS latest version with ~/harmgit/scripts/v5dfield stuff needed below]
cd ~/harmgit/run
cp ~/harmgit/scripts/v5dfield/* .
#cp ~/harmgit/docs/howtouse_joninterp.sh .
cp ~/harmgit/docs/howtouse_joninterp.localsetup.sh .  # this one is setup to be used with local harm ran like in earlier steps.

Can edit this howtouse_joninterp.sh script:

1) Choose "system" (OR create own system case for your system, by going through script and editing system conditionals as required)

2) Choose "whichmodel" OR for new run edit script for your case (i.e. follow through script and add new "whichmodel" case for everywhere whichmodel appears.  This includes the "dumpnum" that is the dump (fieldline file) number.

3) Read through comments in script.  Have to (e.g.) make sure iinterp compiled with correct case for OLDERHEADER

4) boxn? sets Cartesian resolution

5) box?? sets the Cartesian box dimensions

etc.

After editing the script, one can run this from the "run" directory after running harm to get some fieldline files.

BUT, I recommend (as normal) running *PER LINE* to ensure you really setup things correctly.  If there's a conditional, follow it correctly.

6) Then run vis5d: 

vis5d <v5dfilenameyoujustcreated>

NOTE: If you use Nvidia GT630M or such optimus chips with 2 chips on laptop, then setup bumblebee and see: optirun vis5d <etc>

OR scp from ki-jmck and view that file:

scp <user>@ki-jmck.slac.stanford.edu:/tmp/fieldline5700.cart.bin.boxzh40.box100x100x100.out18.modelsashaa99t1.5708.v5d .

vis5d fieldline5700.cart.bin.boxzh40.box100x100x100.out18.modelsashaa99t1.5708.v5d

NOTE: Again, use optirun vis5d if using bumblebee and want accelerated 3D.

7) The v5d file (with format out18 as created by howtouse_joninterp.sh script that uses iinterp):

density: rho0: rest-mass density
ug : internal energy density
uu0: u^t
bsqorho: b^2/rho0
lrho : log(rho0)
neglrho : -log(rho0)
lbsq : log(b^2)
Rcyl : Cylindrical radius
W : v_x
V : v_y
U : v_z
W2 : B_x
V2 : B_y
U2 : B_z
posr : r
posh : \theta
posph : \phi

cd ~/git/harm_harmgit
# edit pfebatchtest
#
# read help about qsub and how to use it on google and http://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/121/
# try running simple 3D test for 1 hour, so edit batch file accordingly.
# note that one #PBS is a command, while more than one # is a comment.
# "select" stands for number of nodes, each "san" having 16 cores/node.  You need to ensure "select" times cores/node is just barely greater than the number of cores you tell harmrad to use with NTOT later.
# ensure you change my email address to yours.
# ensure you change all directories and usernames.

qsub pfebatchtest

# check on your job:
qstat -u <username>  .  E.g., for me <username> is jmckinn2

# you will get an email when the job starts.

# see using batch system and general pfe usage at: http://www.nas.nasa.gov/hecc/support/kb/

# The run will go into: /nobackup/<username>/<jobname>/  e.g., for this test for me: /nobackup/jmckinn2/jon1/
